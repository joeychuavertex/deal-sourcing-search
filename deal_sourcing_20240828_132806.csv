The Problem
The process of creating, analyzing, and iterating ads is currently time-consuming due to the fact that it relies heavily on human capabilities. Humans cannot process big data, factor it all into their decisions, and produce ads quickly. This leads to ineffective advertising, biased decision-making, and scaling issues.  The bigger the budget, the bigger the team, but the less effective it is.

The Solution
AlgoriQ processes data in real-time, regardless of volume, and generates ads for each audience segment based on that data.

Operating in the highly competitive e-commerce market, Katalis AI offers a unique solution to a common problem: the need for high-quality, engaging product content that drives sales. Their AI-driven platform enables clients to generate unlimited product photos, descriptions, and ads quickly and efficiently. This is particularly beneficial for companies with extensive product lines, such as multinational corporations with hundreds of SKUs (Stock Keeping Units).

Katalis AI's business model is centered around providing a subscription-based service that allows clients to access their AI tools. By automating the creation of product listings and advertisements, Katalis AI helps businesses save time and resources while boosting their online presence. The company makes money through subscription fees and possibly additional charges for premium features or higher usage limits.

Similarly, a beauty brand using Katalis AI's services saw significant improvements in their marketing campaigns, leading to more leads and higher sales.

We founded Deeptech Times to offer enterprises, business leaders and policy makers a lens through which they can better understand the progress of these technologies and their consequent issues so that they can make informed decisions. Our lens will particularly zoom in on Asia Pacific where the inventions and innovations and their deployment are occurring rapidly too. 

We want to create conversations with enterprises on the issues they face as they apply advanced technologies to better performance and the communities they live in. We will continue the conversations with the deep tech sector to better understand the challenges of technology adoption. We care about sustainability and innovations that address climate change, the future of transportation, space-age connectivity and exploration, and life science breakthroughs.

HELP is a not-for-profit humanitarian initiative created to support the urgent needs of civilian victims in the Russia-Ukraine war. The solutions resulting from this effort will also be helpful to civilian victims around the World caught in armed conflicts, natural and man-made disasters.

At HELP, we value every life. Driven by this belief, we strive to put the virtue of mutual responsibility into action by supporting and empowering communities in such difficult situations, to look after each other using technology to provide direct relief.

How our HELP App can help
1.   Helping Each Other
It enables immediate and direct charitable sharing of resources by the biggest donor group, individuals from the community who are in proximity, to meet critical humanitarian needs.

2.   Increases Transparency
By not totally relying on intermediaries like NGOs and aid agencies, which can be delayed and require a lot of funds to begin operating and instead, facilitating direct relief by people in proximity, a lot of waste, abuse, misuse, inefficiencies, funds and time could be reduced and reallocated to where it makes the most difference to people who need help.

3.  Direct And Immediate Relief
By capitalising on existing aid amenities, facilities and people already on-site, help can reach civilian victims faster and save lives. People on the ground are in a better position to adjust and adapt to circumstances with first hand knowledge and data intelligence from our App. They can reallocate things and change plans much quicker in a dynamic crisis situation.

3.  Realtime Data For Better Decision Making
Data from the app can help aid agencies and NGOs to better plan for what kind of aid is required, for which territories and by whom and other logistical information for operations. It can help them make important advances that create more lasting and positive change; longer lasting solutions, instead of temporary fixes.","","Others","Civic and Social Organizations","Singapore","8","The company description mentions that they use technology to provide direct relief in humanitarian situations.

Called Share™, what makes it remarkably special, is its pro-client + pro-therapist approach - making lives of both easier and better - effectively reducing churns and platform leakage. This was achieved through hundreds of hours of consultation with stakeholders - from policy makers to teachers, students, practitioners, counselling centres, psychiatric hospital and course providers.

Originally a market estimated at USD187B by 2025, the cumulative impact of COVID-19 now sees it being revised to 374B by 2028.

- 34% not sure where/what to seek
- 28% lacks confidence in treatment
- 22% stigma or fear of people knowing
- 17% cannot afford

Better by technology, Share aims to capture and expand the addressable market, by solving the following pain points commonly associated with therapy:

1. Long waiting time before seeing a therapist - sometimes up to months.

2. Booking can only be made during office hours.

3. No instant availability of therapists - some clients resort to regretful actions as a result.

4. Complicated pricing structure, often dear, dependent on issue, group size and seniority of therapist.

• Our focus is on talents and unique stories across the key hotspots of Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and China. SE Asia and India will be later-stage. We distinguish ourselves in finding the most promising creators and setting them free through a different way of working. We also have special expertise in helping them develop their stories in a way that makes this content succeed globally (not just locally): scripted edgy originals as well as documentaries and reality turned on its head. We are open to hybrid content across gaming and web 3.0. We aim to take full advantage of technology and recast compared to legacy studios. We will use AI and social listening tools to understand global audience trends deeply, thus driving Asian best practices in social marketing to engage prospective fans more effectively. 

• Asian content is having its moment for the first time in modern history. The demand for edgy, Asian-inspired originals is very strong, and all global platforms are keen on diversifying.

Isaac reached out to them previously","","CashWise is a financial technology startup that specializes in creating customized income portfolios for individual investors. The company operates in the investment management market, primarily serving clients who are looking for low-risk, high-yield investment opportunities. CashWise's target clients include individuals who want to maximize their income while minimizing risk, without needing to commit to full bond purchases.

The business model of CashWise revolves around providing personalized investment recommendations. Clients set their preferences, such as the minimum and maximum cash amounts to hold, the deployment amount, and the duration of investments. Based on these preferences, CashWise builds a custom income portfolio strategy, recommending the highest yielding, safe, investment-grade income investments. These investments include treasury bonds and money market funds, which are known for their low risk and high liquidity.

CashWise makes money by charging fees for its portfolio management services. The company leverages recent technological innovations to fractionalize assets, making them more accessible and affordable for individual investors. This means clients can invest in increments as small as $1,000, rather than needing to buy entire bonds.

Once the portfolio recommendations are reviewed and approved by the client, CashWise automatically implements the portfolio. Clients can then sit back and collect their income, as CashWise monitors the portfolio and alerts them if any adjustments are needed. The company also offers an in-person onboarding experience and a free custom treasury management report to help clients get started.

In summary, CashWise provides a streamlined, user-friendly platform for individual investors to achieve high yields with low risk through customized income portfolios.

"ambiguous","Isaac KWA","reject","","Yes","Traditional desgin studio
","","ambiguous is a lighting design studio driven by eco-centrism values, based in Singapore and Tokyo lead by award winning lighting designer Yusuke Hattori.

In lighting design, there is a role beyond improving the appearance of a space. Our aim is to improve the natural environment, including humans, through light and lighting. We recognize that humans are a part of nature and strongly advocate for a shift away from human-centred thinking and towards eco-centrism, or nature-centred thinking.
With this philosophy in mind, we collaborate with a diverse group of people to imagine and explore different ways of using and experiencing light as a material.　

Our design approach is Regenerative Lighting Design. Regenerative means creating positive impacts rather than merely minimizing negative ones, and goes beyond ""sustainable"". Applying this philosophy in the context of lighting design means taking for granted conventional lighting design approaches that reduce negative environmental and social impacts, such as energy conservation and light pollution, and creating light environments that actively contribute to the regeneration and enhancement of natural systems, social systems, and economies, including human. A comprehensive design approach is required, taking into account the interrelationships of many conditions and elements. Our Regenerative lighting design principles are integrated with all our design/ consulting services.

Our company will use light and lighting as materials to design the relationship between architecture and people, cities and nature. As collaborators, we will also be experts in exploring the ways light and lighting can and should be used.

We are always looking for new challenges and interesting collaborators.","","Others","Design Services","Singapore","2","Based on the given company description and website text, it is unlikely that this company is a technology start-up.

"The Legacy Project","Isaac KWA","reject","","Yes","Content producer
","","[WHO WE ARE]

A collective of creatives who craft autobiography shorts for those who are dying or have died - through photos, film and the written word. 

[WHY WE DO THIS]

Dying is a really hard thing for everyone involved, no matter how you prepare yourself for it. 

The heartbeat of The Legacy Project is to confer honour upon the one who is passing or has passed, by telling the story of their life and the legacy that they leave behind, and to help their loved ones grief and remember the person that they are. 

Think of it as a personal “hero story” or biography short.

We believe that every human life has deep meaning and a legacy that continues to ripple on, but sometimes these are in the unseen elements and simply requires a witness to make it seen. We want to be that witness. 

[HOW WE TELL THE STORIES]

Much like how a biography is approached, interviews will be done with the passing person and/or their close loved ones, which will then be weaved into a written story by the Storyteller. 

Sometimes the real essence of a person is unseen to themselves and those around them, and requires someone to perceive, connect the dots, and make that known. That’s what the Storytellers will do.

The written stories will be beautifully paired with pictures of them and their loved ones by the Photographers. Who and what we photograph will be dependent on their comfort level and their story, and approached with respectful sensitivity. 

The purpose of the final story is not to simply recount events, but to pull out and witness to who the person is, and the unique essence they embody - their legacy to the earth. 

[RATES]
$900 for a full story.  

Each story includes: 
- a series of at least 50 photos
- a written autobiography short of the individual of at least 20 pages
- a final edited photo story e-book
- unlimited interview sessions with the individual, family and friends","","Others","Broadcast Media Production and Distribution","Singapore","2","Based on the given description, it is unlikely that this company is a technology start-up.

While many celebrate burn rates, funds raised and the glamour of being in the press, we feel most successful businesses are based on unique customer insights and are often ‘boring’ in nature. For example: mailchimp, audiopen, tweethunter and many more.

Value is created when teams are small and frugal. Our DNA is to incubate and invest in start-ups that are built on AI-first principles. That redefines the cost to build, cost of operations, and experiences that truly delight customers. In fact we are limiting the size of each product to be no more than 7-10 people.
